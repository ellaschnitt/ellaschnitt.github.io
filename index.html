            <h2>Blog post: "Dressing To Impress: How TikTok Aesthetics Define Identity (and Limit Authenticity)" </h2>           
            <p class="description">A Medium blog post detailing the effect of TikTok "aesthetic" culture on personal identity. Here I expand upon the regularly-discussed topic of fashion trend cycles by focusing on how they can affect an individual's sense of self-expression, and how often young people feel pressured to dress in a way that reflects how they'd like others to perceive them. As a person who has fallen into this mindset in the past (and often still today) while also recognizing its many flaws, I believe I offer a unique voice to this topic. <a href="https://medium.com/@ellaschnitt/dressing-to-impress-how-tiktok-aesthetics-define-identity-and-limit-authenticity-aa44447e4762">Check it out here!</a></p>

          <h2>Podcast: "Fandom Freaks"</h2>  
          <p class="description">
            A group podcast project examining obsessive fan culture through an interview with a massive Harry Styles fan. Here, my podcast group and I interview one member who we dub as a "Fandom Freak" due to her immense love for pop sensation Harry Styles. We talk about some of the wilder aspects of fan culture including celebrity stalking and fan-fiction, including one written Harry Styles fanfiction in particular that was eventually published and adapted into a feature film. With a lighthearted tone and a somewhat dry/sarcastic sense of humor, the podcast is an quick and entertaining listen. <a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/7adxQ" >Check it out here!</a></p>

          <h2>Video: "Painting When You're Feeling Down: My Process + Reflection"</h2>
          <p class="description">
           A video project in which I show my painting process while also discussing my inspiration behind the piece as well as my reasons for painting in general. What I initially started as a painting tutorial eventually became something else entirely; a more laid-back and personal discussion where I explain how art and painting can help me cope with life stressors and negative feelings. Instead of instructing viewers to follow any kind of step-by-step tutorial, I instead encourage them to "just go for it", combating worries of mistakes or failures. I am very proud of this video and hope that its message will help people dealing with mental or emotional stressors feel a little less alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/zwWpAOADXAc" >Click here to watch.</a></p>
